<h1>Web Design Evaluation</h1>
<h2>Website Information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>URL: <a href="https://www.mathway.com/Algebra" target="_blank">Mathway.com</a></li>
	<li>Name: Mathway.</li>
	<li>Target Audience: Students and/or Teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Site Organization</h2>
	<p>The site uses a hierachical with two navigation menu on the top left and top right. The top left menu let the users change among different subjects or different level of mathematics; The top right menu provides more information about the website for the users. </p>
</body>
<h2>CRAP Design Principle</h2>
<p>The site uses the Repetition, Proximity, and Alighnment principles. For example, all the buttons represented the numbers and all the mathematics functions are all sitting at the bottom of the website; All the simple functions and numbers are all on the left side and all the more complicated functions are all on the right side. There are gaps and spaces between the buttons and since all the buttons have the same size, it creates rows and columms of numbers and functions.</p>
<h2>Navigation Design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Navigation: Users can click on the top left menu and a columm of different subjects will appear and allows them to change the subject.</li>
<li>Site Search Feature: When users click on the top right menu, a search function called Examples appears and allow them to search for different mathematics examples.</li>
<li>Site map: The top right menu provides access to more information about the site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Design Best Practices Checklist</h2>
<p>Shortcomming(s):</p>
<ul>
	<li>Configure frames with frame title and place meaningful content in the noframes area.</li>
	<li>Captions are provided for each audio or video file used.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendation:</h2>
<p>Since Mathway only shows the final answer for a problem and only allow users to see step-by-step answers when they pay for a subscription, having a chat room will be great. A set up like discord will be amazing; where everyone can come in and share information on math problems or other subjects.</p>
