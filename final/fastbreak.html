    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Start at half court with a ball.

      </p>

      <p>Spin the ball towards the 3-point line area. Spin the ball high enough to get there in one bounce.


</p>
      <p>Run under the ball and step-into a jump shot.

</p>
      <p>Get your own rebound. If you miss, score a lay up.

</p>
<p>When dribbling the ball back to half-court, perform a dribble move at the 3-point line. That way, you can work on ball-handling at the same time.</p>

  
      <p>Once, you get back to half court, do the same thing again.

</p>
      <p>If working with a partner, you can have the partner position himself a little above the 3-point line and make passes to you as you start running from half-court.


</p>
<p>Pick 4 spots on the floor and take a few shots from each spot.
