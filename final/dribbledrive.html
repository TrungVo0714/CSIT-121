    <h2>Breaking Down the Direct and Crossover Drive</h2>
    <p>Because a player can be coming at them from any side, you need to make sure your players are comfortable driving on both the right and left sides.

If you are a right handed player:

If you go to your right side, that is called a “Direct Drive”.

If you go to your left side, that is a “Crossover Drive”

Your left foot is your turning foot

Your right foot is your stepping foot.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Direct Drive</h2>
<p>Begin in “ready” Quick Stance position.
With your right foot, take a big step forward, long and low. You want to take a long step, and get as low as you can get and hold that position.
The back leg should be straight and the imaginary ball should be right in front of that right hand, ready to dribble.</p>
<h2>Breaking Down the Crossover Drive</h2>
<p>Begin in “ready” Quick Stance position.
The first thing you are going to do is take the ball across your body to the opposite side and circle tight. The left hand should be behind the ball.
With the same stepping foot (the right foot if right handed), you are going to cross step long and low.
The ball should now be in the left hand, ready to dribble.</p>
