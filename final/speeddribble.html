    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Ball handler will start a few steps in front of the defender, above the baseline.
</p>
      <p>The defender will start on the baseline on the inside of the offensive player.

</p>
      <p>They both go at the same time. Offensive player is attempting to beat the defender to the opposite basket for a lay up.
</p>
      <p>The defender is sprinting to cut the offensive player off before reaching the basket.
</p>
<h2>Initiating the Action
</h2>
  
      <p>With larger groups, you can have the offensive player initiate the action.  As soon as offensive player moves, the defense starts chasing.  


</p>
      <p>To get more reps, you can have players going both directions at the same time (as shown in diagram).  Tell players not to cross the "rim line".
