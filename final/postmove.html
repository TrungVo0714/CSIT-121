    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>You start with the basketball on the chair in the paint and 2 players standing on the free throw line
      </p>

      <p>Coach says "Go" and the players explode to touch baseline and race to the basketball.


</p>
      <p>Whichever player gets to the ball first is on offense and immediately tries to score. The second player is on defense.

</p>
      <p>Live play continues until someone scores.
</p>
<p>Winner stays and plays the next person in line</p>
<h2>Points of Emphasis
</h2>
  
      <p>Play Low - You want to start low to be in a strong, balanced position. That way, the defender can't easily nudge you out of position. It also puts you in a good position to play through contact.


</p>
      <p>Chin the Ball & Elbows Wide - You chin the ball and get your elbows wide to protect the ball from the defenders. Chinning the ball also keeps the ball up and away from the perimeter defenders sliding to try to swipe at the ball. If you have the ball too low, it makes easier for these defenders to steal the ball.

</p>
<p>Go hard! This is LIVE play. Go hard to simulate game action. That way, you get comfortable playing against competition similar to the game.
</p>
<p>Rebound, rebound, rebound! Don't quit on the shot. Just like during the game, you need to attack the boards after each shot. And you can score on the misses. From a defensive standpoint, you also need to try to finish the play with a good box out then secure the rebound.
