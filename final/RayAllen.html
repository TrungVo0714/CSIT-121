    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>The Ray Allen shooting drill is a great drill that you can use for a shooting warm up or to end the workout in a fun, competitive manner. It can easily be adapted for beginners and pros. Check out the instructions, diagrams, and video below for more details.


      </p>

      <p>You have to make a shot from spot 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 in 5 consecutive shots in order to advance to the next line.




</p>
      <p>If you miss from any of the spots, you start over in that line. If you miss a shot in line 3, you start over from line 3. You don't go back to line 1.


</p>
      <p>Your goal is to finish all 5 lines in 2 minutes.

</p>
<p>Move back a spot after each make - Rather than making 5 shots in a row, you allow the players to move back a spot after each make even if they miss in between.
</p>

      <p>Use 3 or 4 Spots - Instead of using 5 spots, you can make it a little bit easier by only making them go to spot 3 or 4.



</p>
      <p>6 Spots - For more advanced players, you can add an extra spot.


</p>
<p>Kyle Korver Status - Make 25 shots in a row.
